Bottom Left Cube: Was the cube set to create in the tutorial, uses the MeshPhongMaterial function 2 color values for viewing and a number to set how shiny the cube will be.
Upper Left Cube: Is a cube I was to create on my own using the three.js library. This function is the MeshToonMaterial function which with 2 color values for viewing and a number to set how shiny it is. This creates a more matte colored cube to look like something out of a 3D cartoon.
Bottom Right Cube: This cube creates it's own shader using a vertex shader file as well as a fragment shader. With the fragment shader the "mix" allows two colors to be fused together to give the interpolated effect.
Upper Right Cube: This cube is incomplete. I did not understand the concept of making my own shader in the given handout enough to make a more unique cube. I attempted to follow a youtube video to make something more special except failed as seen in my code. The line commented out in line 181 is what kept breaking my program. I spent hours on hours trying to fix it, I believe the issue in the vshader1 value that I could not access for some reason in my addAnotherCube function. Although still could not find the absolute solution. If it is possible to go into making your own shader a little more that would be very helpful, I could not figure it out on my own based on copying and pasting old code.
